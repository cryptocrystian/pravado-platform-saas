# PRAVADO STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
## Complete Dependency Mapping & Coordinated Execution

---

## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTATION PHILOSOPHY: "FOUNDATION FIRST, FEATURES SECOND"**

### **Critical Insight from Project Analysis:**
Based on our comprehensive planning, we have **5 major systems** that must be coordinated:

1. **Enhanced Design System** (Sophisticated grayscale + motion language)
2. **Information Architecture** (Complete screen mapping + navigation)
3. **AI Onboarding System** (20-minute progressive disclosure wizard)
4. **Agentic AI Features** (CiteMind™, autonomous optimization, GEO)
5. **Enterprise Foundation** (Multi-tenant, roles, integrations)

**Problem**: These systems have complex interdependencies that can cause rework if implemented incorrectly.
